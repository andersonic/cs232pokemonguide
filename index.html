			<h3>A Pokémon</h3>
			<p>
Every species has one or two types, a set list of moves it can learn and abilities it can have. Each species also has "base stats." Each individual Pokémon can learn up to four moves from the list of moves its species can learn, and has exactly one ability from the list of abilities its species can have. Each individual can also have its base stats customized thrgouh EVs, IVs and Natures (more on this later). Additionally, every Pokémon can hold one item. Item is completely independent of species.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div id="moves">
			<h3>Moves</h3>
			<p>A move can either deal damage, temporarily boost stats, or have a special effect (such as causing a status effect). Moves that deal damage are categorized as either physical or special, and have exactly one type. Pokémon can use moves of any type, but if the type of the attacking move matches the type of the user, the attack does more damage.<br><br>Moves also have priority. Higher priority moves go before lower priority moves regardless of the user's speed (See stats for further information on speed).</p>
		</div>
		<div id="types">
			<h3>Types</h3>
			<p>There are eighteen types. A type can be immune to another type (damage x 0), resistant (damage x 1/2), neutral (damage x 1), or weak to (damage x 2) another type. Damage modifiers multiply for dual-typed Pokémon. Google "Pokémon type chart" to see which types are weak to what.<br><br>NOTE: the type of the ATTACKING MOVE and DEFENDING POKÉMON are what count for type advantage/disadvantage.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="stats">
			<h3>Stats</h3>
			<p>
There are six stats.
				<ul>
					<li>Health Points (HP): When a Pokémon runs out of these, it faints.</li>
					<li>Attack (Atk): More attack = more damage dealt with physical attacks. </li>
					<li>Defense (Def): More defense = less damage taken from physical attacks.</li>
					<li>Special Attack(SpA): More SpA = more damage dealth with special attacks.</li>
					<li>Special Defense (SpD): More SpD = less damage taken from special attacks.</li>
					<li>Speed (Spe): Whichever Pokémon has higher Speed moves first if both Pokémon select moves of equal priority.
					</li>
				</ul>
Every species has base stats that affect, but are not equal to, its stats at level 100 before customization. On top of base stats, each individual can distribute 63 points to any of its stats, but cannot add more than 31 points to any individual stat (technically, it has 510 points w/ no more than 255 to each stat, with 4 points required for one stat point). Each individual also has IVs for each stat that range from 0-31, with each IV corresponding to one additional stat point at level 100; there is almost no reason not to have 31 IVs in each stat.<br><br>Lastly, there are natures. A nature raises one stat by 10% and lowers another by 10%; every combination is available as well as 5 "neutral" natures that raise and lower the same stat.

		<div id="status">
			<h3>Status Effects</h3>
			<div>
				<p>A Pokémon can only have one status effect at a time; if it has one, it is immune to all others. Status effects persist after switchout unless otherwise noted.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Burn: lose 12% of total HP at the end of each turn, and halve attack</li>
					<li>Paralysis: 10% chance to fail to move, and speed reduced to 25%</li>
					<li>Freeze: Cannot make moves. 20% chance to defrost each turn; able to move the turn of defrosting. Can also defrost if hit by a fire-type attack.</li>
					<li>Sleep: Cannot mave moves. Will sleep for a set number of turns between (I think 1 and 4? Not sure) determine by a roll when sleep is inflicted. Can move the turn it wakes up.</li>
					<li>Poison: lose 12% of total HP at the end of each turn.</li>
					<li>Toxic: lose 6% of total HP at the end of the first turn of toxic, 12% at the end of the second turn of toxic, and so on. The turn counter resets upon switchout.</li>
					<li>Confusion: 50% chance to do damage to self each turn. Is cured upon switching out.</li>
					<li>Must recharge: cannot move or switch. Ends after one turn.</li>
				</ul>

			<h3>A Team</h3>
			<p>
Consists of six Pokémon. In competitive battling, a team must comply with certain restrictions, among them that every Pokémon on the team must be of a different species. There is also a list of species, moves and items that are not allowed.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div id="abattle">
			<h3>A Battle</h3>
			<p>
Two teams go head-to-head. One Pokémon from each team is active, and the remaining are benched, at any given time. Each player independently selects which Pokémon to send out first. From there, turns play out until one player wins. A player wins by knocking out all of their opponent's Pokémon.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div id="aturn">
			<h3>A Turn</h3>
			<p>
Each player independently chooses an action. They can either have their active Pokémon make a move, or they can switch their active Pokémon out for one (that is not fainted) on the bench. If both Pokémon are to move, whichever move has higher priority goes first. If the moves are of equal priority, the faster Pokémon moves first. If a Pokémon faints as the result of the opponent's move, it faints immediately (as in, if it has not yet moved, it will not move). Switching occurs before Pokémon move, so if one player attacks and the other switches, the switch-in will take the attack. Some moves and abilities prevent switching, while one (Pursuit) is able to hit the Pokémon that is switching out, rather than the one that comes in to replace it.<br><br>At the end of a turn, if your Pokémon fainted, you must send another out. If all of your Pokémon have fainted, you lose. If both players’ last Pokémon faint in the same turn, there is a long list of rules that determines who won (there are no ties).
